# thong
OK there some awesome bioinformatics suites out there, this isnt one.  Just links NGS data together that have been split between lanes.
Merger for FASTQ files. Uses tkinter to load your modules. I usually use Python 3.5+ and so I guess that is required.
Very new to Gitub. these are the same file. The original was called FASTQMERGER.py, but I realised that implied it WAS fast and it isn't so renamed to "thong". can't delete the old version :-/
